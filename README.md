DistributedComputingFundamentals
Repository for PESU I/O Slot 7 course Fundamentals of Distributed and Cloud Computing. Will contain examples for the Distributed Computing component of said course.

Week 2:
index and index2 are sample HTML files to be used for the assignments in weeks 2 and 3.
Week 2 will involve just creating a similar HTML file and logging into a container.
The final result can include much more than index and index2;however, the more important part of this week's assignment is logging into container, so keep the focus on that.

Submission deadline:
Sunday,8th September, 11:55 PM.
