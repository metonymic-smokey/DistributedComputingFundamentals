# DistributedComputingFundamentals

Repository for PESU I/O Slot 7 course Fundamentals of Distributed and Cloud Computing. Will contain examples for the Distributed Computing component of said course.

**Week 2:**  
index and index2 are sample HTML files to be used for the assignments in weeks 2 and 3.  
Week 2 will involve just creating a similar HTML file and logging into a container.    
The final result can include much more than index and index2;however, the more important part of this week's assignment is logging into container, so keep the focus on that.  

**Submission deadline:  
Sunday,8th September, 11:55 PM.**

**Submission:**.   
This week's assignment will be submitted differently, compared to last week's.  
Steps to submit:  
1.Login to Github.  
2.Fork this repository.  
Once this is done, the team member forking the repo should go back to their account and check if they have a new repo now.  
3.Edit README.md by adding your team number and teammates' names.   
Equally important, list the sources referred to while creating you static web pages.  
4.The file docker_script.sh contains individual commands to be run in order to complete this weeks assignment, in the correct order.  
5.Push an nginx image to Dockerhub by tagging it with your team number,using a team member's Dockerhub username.  
An example of such an image is: aditiahuja/Team3.    
6.Change either index.html or index2.html by adding your team's HTML code.      
Also, change docker_script.sh to inlude the exact commands used by your team.           
7.Edit README.md in your fork with a link to the Dockerhub repository.    
8.Commit your changes and verify that the changes have been added.  
9.Email me a link to your team repo on the same email ID as last week.   

**Week 3:**. 
This week's assignment consists of deploying last time's static web page on NGINX locally i.e. instead of the default NGINX content, your web page will be displayed. Create a new folder in your forked repos and add a folder labelled Week 3. In it, create a file, with the commands you have used to do the above. This file will be of the same format as the docker_scripts.sh file last time.
